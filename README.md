-  Hi, I’m @anonymousthesecond.I write all my code on a decade old computer with 4GB ram and an intel core i3 processor and an AI that looks for and solves mistakes in my code and another AI to write the readme file.
-  I’m interested in ...MATH OFCOURSE AND RELATED SUBJECTS
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...I know more programming languages than even AI(asian power) but I never spend time writing readme files for my repositories.I always get that written by gemini or chatgpt.I have provided a game written in perl here as this is a special repository.
- CODE TRANSLATION-IF YOU WANT ME TO TRANSLATE CODE FROM ONE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE TO ANOTHER,OR IF YOU HAVE ANY ENQUIRIES OR ANYTHING WORK-RELATED,MAIL ME AT- mathg5576@gmail.com
  I'll respond if it falls within my skills.
